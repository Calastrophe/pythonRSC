# pyRSC ( Relatively Simple Computer in Python )

pyRSC is an emulator for the RSC architecture written in Python.

There is a dependency on BitVector.
To download BitVector's package, just use **pip install BitVector**

To use this simply provide a microcode file, like given in tests and run it through the pyRSC emulator.

You can use the assembler to output the binary format needed for Logisim, if need be.

There is a branch for the debugger and other interfaces currently in progress.
